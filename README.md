# Crop-Watcher-Project

My Capstone project which consisted of 3 nodes which wirelessly communicated crop related info (temperature, humidity, soil moisture and ambient light) back to a central hub to eventually be stored in a database.

The code for the nodes and hub are written for Arduinos since thats what was used to make them.
